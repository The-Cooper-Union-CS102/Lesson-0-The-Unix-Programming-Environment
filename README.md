# The Unix Programming Environment

An operating system in the main software that your computer runs on, like
Windows, macOS, or Linux.

The Unix programming environment is a set of similar operating systems which
are commonly used for software development.  Its development began about fifty
years ago at Bell Labs, and it is still the foundation of most modern
development workflows.  This section will introduce you to the environment, and
show you how to do some useful things.

## The Unix Philosophy

First, let's discuss the "Unix Philosophy".  Below is a set of four points
which outline the design principles of unix operating systems, and software
development in general.

1. Make each program do one thing well. To do a new job, build afresh rather
than complicate old programs by adding new "features".
2. Expect the output of every program to become the input to another, as yet
unknown, program. Don't clutter output with extraneous information. Avoid
stringently columnar or binary input formats. Don't insist on interactive
input.
3. Design and build software, even operating systems, to be tried early,
ideally within weeks. Don't hesitate to throw away the clumsy parts and rebuild
them.
4. Use tools in preference to unskilled help to lighten a programming task,
even if you have to detour to build the tools and expect to throw some of them
out after you've finished using them.

This is commonly summarized in this more digestible format:

1. Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
2. Write programs to work together.
3. Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface

This advice is not meant to apply to all types of programs, but it will get you
far, and it will help you understand Unix.

## Operating System, Terminal, Shell

First, let's clarify some terminology.

An **Operating System** is software on your computer that *other* software runs
on top of.  The operating system has special control over other programs, which
is necessary for security and organization.  For example, suppose there is some
malicious or bugged piece of software on your computer.  A good operating
system will let you 'kill' that piece of software so it does not compromise all
of your other work.  Similarly, your computer only has so much hardware
available to the good programs which must be divvied.  This is another problem
that the operating system solves.

A **Terminal** is any program running on your operating system that allows you
to read text based output from programs.

A **Shell** is any program that runs on a terminal and allows you to interact
with programs interactively via text commands.  We will focus on learning
a shell called **`bash`** but that being said, most of what we learn will
transfer directly to other shells.

From those definitions, a terminal and a shell might sounds pretty similar and
they are.  Put more simply:  The terminal and shell both live on the operating
system.  The shell is what allows you to interact with programs.  The terminal
is simply a middleman that transcribes your input from the keyboard to the
shell, and then takes the shell's output and and displays it to your monitor.

## Directories and Files

Almost all operating systems use the concept of directories and files.

A file contains data stored on a hard drive.

A directory, also commonly referred to as a folder, contains a collection of
directories and files.

Because directories may branch off into more directories, one may refer to a
directory and its contents as a tree, with files and emtpy directories being
leaves.  For example, I could describe a directory in English like this:

```
* A directory named directory_1, containing:
    * A directory named directory_1, containing:
        * A directory named directory_1 containing nothing
    * A directory named directory_2, containins:
        * A file named file_1
        * A directory named directory_3, containing nothing.
    * A file named file_1
```

Or I may simply write the tree format like this:

```
/directory_1/
    directory_1/
        directory_1/
    directory_2/
        file_1
        directory_3/
    file_1
```

Note that the names do not have to be unique if two things are in different
directories.  This is because when we specify a folder or file, we can specify
it with its "path" from the "root" of the tree.  For example one file could
be specified by `/directory_1/directory_2/file_1` while the other could be
specified by `/directory_1/file_1`.  You could think of it like a family
tree, referring to directories which come before as **parents**, and
directories which come after as **children**.  Keep in mind though that
any child in this case has one and only one parent.

It is important to understand that a shell is always *inside* a **working directory**,
from which you can specify files by their **relative** path.  Going back to the
previous example, if I were using a shell *inside* `directory_2`, I could take a
shortcut and just write `file_1` instead of `/directory_1/directory_2/file_1`.

There are some other drectory shortcut symbols in most shells, including bash:

* `.`: The **working directory**
* `..`: The **parent** of the working directory
* `~`: The **home** directory.
* `-`: The **previous** working directory


## Getting Setup

Getting setup with your terminal depends on your operating system, and some
support it better than others.  This section provides a short guide on getting
set up in Linux, macOS, and (most painfully) Windows.

### Linux

1. Press `Ctrl+Alt+T`.

### macOS

1. Press `âŒ˜+space`.
2. Search for and open `terminal`.
3. (Optional) Install *iTerm2* for a better experience.

### Windows

I recommend [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) which you can download directly
[here](https://www.cygwin.com/setup-x86_64.exe)

1. Choose all default options.
2. When it asks you to choose a download site, pick any.
3. When it asks you to select packages, search for `gcc-g++`, navigate into
`All` -> `Devel` -> `gcc-g++` and select the latest version from the dropdown
4. Now search for `make`, navigate to `All` -> `Devel` -> `make` and select the
latest version
5. Now search `python`, navigate to `All` -> `Python`.  Select the latest
versions for `python38`, `python38-devel`, `python38-pip`,
`python38-setuptools`, and `python38-virtualenv`.

If you miss one of these steps, you can always run the executable again to
install it.

## Using a Shell

Now that we've gotten all the definitions out of the way, let's take a look
at what it actually means to use the shell.

> Interactive Demonstration

### `pwd`

First, you might be able to tell your current directory by just looking at the
prompt.  But in case you can't, you can explicitly print the working directory
with `pwd`

### `man`

Format and display the on-line manual pages

#### Examples

* `man man`
* `man bash`
* `man ls`

### `ls`

List all directory contents

#### Examples

* `ls`
* `ls .`
* `ls ..`
* `ls ~`

### `mkdir`

Create a directory

#### Examples

* `mkdir MyDir`


### `cd`

Change (navigate into a) directory

#### Examples

* `help cd`
* `cd MyDir`
* `cd .`
* `cd ..`
* `cd ~`
* `cd -`

### `touch`

Create file or change timestamp on existing file

#### Examples

* `ls -ld .`
* `touch .`
* `ls -ld .`
* `touch NewFile`

### `echo`

Print to standard output (your screen)

#### Examples

* `echo "hello"`

### `cat`

Concatenate and print files

#### Examples

* `cat`
* `cat data/sample.txt`

### `cp`

Copy files

#### Examples

* `cp NewFile CopiedFile`
* `cp -r Mydir CopiedDir`

### `mv`

move (or rename) files

#### Examples

* `mv NewFile SameFile`

### `rm`

Remove files

#### Examples

* `rm CopiedFile`
* `rm -r CopiedDir`

### `chmod`

Change file modes (permissions)

#### Examples

* `chmod +x hello.sh`

### Other Commands

You will likely come across other commands not mentioned here.  Remember, `man`
is your friend.  Some other common commands are:

`ln`, `chown`, `find`, `du`, `df`, `less`, `head`, `tail`, `grep`,
`sort`, `wc`, `diff`, `pkill`, `top`, `time`, `sudo`, `alias`

### Wildcards

`man bash` (Search for **Pathname Expansion**)

#### Examples

* `echo *`
* `ls *.md`
* `ls *.??`

### Redirection

#### Examples

* `echo "Hello, world" > hello.txt`
* `echo "Hello, you" >> hello.txt`

### Pipe

#### Examples

* `ls | sort`
* `cat roster.csv | sort`
* `cat roster.csv | sort | cut -f1`
* `cat roster.csv | sort | cut -f1 | cut -d' ' -f2`
* `cat roster.csv | sort | cut -f1 | rev | cut -d' ' -f1 | rev`
* `cat roster.csv | cut -f1 | rev | cut -d' ' -f1 | rev | sort --ignore-case`
* `cat roster.csv | cut -f1 | rev | cut -d' ' -f1 | rev | sort --ignore-case | uniq -c`
* `sort roster.csv -R | cut -f1 | head -n1`
* `sort < roster.csv | tee sorted.txt | uniq`

### Productivity Tips

* `up-arrow` lets your scroll through your history of commands.
* `ctrl+r` lets you search your history.
* `tab` autocompletes file names
* You can use `vim` or `emacs` to edit files from your terminal

## Bash Scripting

All of the previous commands can be run directly on the terminal, however they
can also be put into a "shell script."

#### Example

This is an example of a script that creates a new directory, creates a new
file in that directory, and adds content to the file.

```bash
mkdir newDir
touch newDir/newFile
echo "Here is some content." > newDir/newFile
```

Note that the file may not be "executable" by default meaning you may need be
able to run the code.  There are two ways around this.

1. Make the file executable by running `chmod +x snippets/script_0.sh` 2. Run
the file directly in your terminal with `source snippets/script_0.sh` or `.
code/bash_1.sh`

### Variables

You can store data in "variables" for later use.

#### Example

```bash
myName="Cory Nezin"
echo $myName
```

You can also store the output of commands in variables

#### Example

```bash
mydir=$(pwd)
echo $mydir
```

You can also read files into variables like this:

```
myData=$(<roster.csv)
echo $myData
```

You can concatenate variables as follows:

```bash
a="Cory"
b="Nezin"
c=$a$b
echo $c
```

When running a script, you can pass values at run time like this:

```bash
firstname=$1
lastname=$2
echo "Hello, first name: $firstname last name: $lastname"
```

## Conclusion

From this lesson, you should be a little more familiar with how to use a
terminal and a shell.  However it takes a lot of practice to become proficient,
so get out there and start working on it.
